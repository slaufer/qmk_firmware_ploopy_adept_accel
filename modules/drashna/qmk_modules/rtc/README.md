# RTC (Real-time Clock)

This enables real time clock functionality, to be able to set the date and time locally in the firmware and keep it synced.

Add the following to the list of modules in your `keymap.json` to enable this module:

```json
{
    "modules": ["drashna/rtc"]
}
```

If a time has not been set for the RTC, then the compile date and time are used for the initial initialization. This won't be completely accurate, but should only be off by a matter of seconds, in most cases. And should be good enough to get you going.

## String Report Functions

All of these functions return a pre-formatted date/time in a string. Great for OLED/Quantum Painter display, or console logging.

## Supported Hardware

By default, "vendor" is the selected RTC hardware. This requires hardware support for the RTC and may require hardware config. And obviously, requires a battery to be hooked up to the appropriate pins.

|  Driver   | Description                                                                                                               | Links                                             |
| :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `vendor`  | This allows for build in hardware support of the RTC functionality. AVR is not supported, and RP2040 is currently bugged. |                                                   |
| `ds3231`  | A low cost and high precision I2C based RTC module with integrated temperature compensation. Supports 5V and 3.3V.        | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5188) |
| `ds1307`  | A low cost I2C based RTC module. May lose up to 2 seconds a day. "Requires" 5V power.                                     | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3296) |
| `pcf8523` | A super low cost I2C based RTC module. May lose up to 2 seconds a day. Supports 5V and 3.3V.                              | [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5189) |

### Vendor Hardware

As mentioned above, currently, RP2040 is not supported by the vendor hardware due to a bug in the RTC driver code. And I'm not sure where it is (it looks to match the pico-SDK code, which does apparently work fine).

For STM32 based chips, you will need to check your schematic and data sheet to see if RTC support is available, and how to support it. Ideally, you should have an LSE crystal, and the RTC should be configured to use it. This will get you the most reliable functionality, from what I understand.

As an example, the [STM32F405 Tractyl Manuform](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/e3c613c79c2211163abb914c8725cb495942fbb9/keyboards/handwired/tractyl_manuform/5x6_right/f405/mcuconf.h#L21-L28) has RTC enabled at the keyboard level, for instance.

```c
#undef STM32_LSE_ENABLED
#define STM32_LSE_ENABLED TRUE

#undef STM32_RTCSEL
#define STM32_RTCSEL STM32_RTCSEL_LSE
```

Also, to ensure that the keyboard keeps time after power loss, you will need to ensure a battery is hooked up (a simple coin cell battery is more than enough for this), and that the controller has the correct circuitry to support this. WeAct's Blackpill (STM32F4x1) and CoreBoard (STM32F405) have all the required components and I have personally verified that they do work.
